NAME
    Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI - Proverb phrases from Kamus
    Besar Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of
    Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI (from Perl distribution
    Games-Word-Phraselist-Proverb-KBBI), released on 2014-08-10.

SYNOPSIS
      use Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI;
      my $wl = Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI->new;
      my $word = $wl->random_phrase;
      print "We have a phrase." if $wl->is_phrase($word);

DESCRIPTION
    "Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI" subclasses
    Games::Word::Phraselist, giving you proverbs preloaded with the
    Indonesian words from Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (currently the third
    edition, 2001).

    Because the data source is currently not fully cleansed (it is from
    earlier effort: https://github.com/sharyanto/stardict ), I removed some
    entries.

    Some stats:

     Number of phrases: 1714
     Shortest phrase length: 28 (including whitespace)
     Longest phrase length: 104 (including whitespace)
     Average phrase length: 31.2 characters (including whitespace)

    Since "Games::Word::Phraselist" is subclassed, all its methods (except
    "new") are available.

    Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia is the definitive Indonesian dictionary,
    published by Pusat Bahasa.
