NAME
    Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI - Proverb phrases from Kamus
    Besar Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian)

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.02 of
    Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI (from Perl distribution
    Games-Word-Phraselist-Proverb-KBBI), released on 2014-08-10.

SYNOPSIS
      use Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI;
      my $pl = Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI->new;
      my $phrase = $pl->random_phrase;
      print "We have a phrase." if $pl->is_phrase($phrase);

DESCRIPTION
    "Games::Word::Phraselist::Proverb::KBBI" subclasses
    Games::Word::Phraselist, giving you phrases of Indonesian proverbs from
    Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia (currently the third edition, 2001).

    Because the data source is currently not fully cleansed (it is from
    earlier effort: https://github.com/sharyanto/stardict ), I removed some
    entries.

    Some stats:

     Number of phrases: 1714
     Shortest phrase length: 11 (including whitespace)
     Longest phrase length: 104 (including whitespace)
     Average phrase length: 31.2 characters (including whitespace)

    Since "Games::Word::Phraselist" is subclassed, all its methods (except
    "new") are available.

    Kamus Besar Bahasa Indonesia is the definitive Indonesian dictionary,
    published by Pusat Bahasa.
